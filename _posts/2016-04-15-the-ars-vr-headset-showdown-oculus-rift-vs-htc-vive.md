C. KING is a clothing collection created by Baltimore born artists, Keith King and [c.BARR][1]([@n8tivalien][2]) . With the use of found objects and hand-cut stencils, each garment is dyed and distressed to create a one of a kind work of expression. The graphics often promote ideas about knowledge and self actualization.
